# Snake

## Objectives

A classic snake game I built while learning Python. I use pygame to handle graphics, music etc.


## Dependencies
Snake was developed and tested on reasonably recent python versions. Currently, I'm using Python 3.8.3.

I usually work from within a virtual environment (conda in my case) with PIP and the packages listed below.

Snake depends on the following packages:
  * pygame

if you use pip, install pygame like this:

```
pip install -U pygame==2.0.0.dev10
```
